/**
  * Cristiano:Phantom Types
  *
  * When such types are defined that have no instances at all,
  * they are called phantom types.
  * That’s a fancy name, but it just means that we only care that
  * the type exists.
  * It functions as a “marker” We won’t actually use any instances of it.
  *
  * Phantom types are very useful for defining work flows that
  * must proceed in a particular order.
  *
  * Note the sealed traits with no data and no classes that implement them.
  * Because they are “sealed,” they can’t be implemented in other files.
  * Hence, they only serve as “markers”
  * These markers are used as type parameters for the Pay type.
